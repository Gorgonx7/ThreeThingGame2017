Advanced Space Development Agency (ASDA)

A sub-division of ProBono MegaIndustries (PBMI)


These are a set of 5x7 tiles which can be put together and used to create space vessels for your role playing games.

The tiles are sized 5x7 because Walmart (ASDA in the UK) allows cheap printing of the pictures in 5"x7".


You may use the tiles for your personnal games but may not use them for commercial purposes, as they were originally created in the Dundjinni program. For those with Dundjinni, there are a number of ~properties files, which are used by the program. If you do not have Dundjinni, you may ignore or delete those files.


They, along with Dungeon, Mansion, Mall and other tilesets,  are kept online in RpgMapShare thanks to Steel Rat. A number of sample spacecraft are also provided on the site.


Enjoy!
